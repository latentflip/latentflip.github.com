I am the CTO and co-founder of [Float](http://floatapp.com), a web-app that helps small business owners understand, monitor and forecast their cash-flow.

I live in “sunny” Edinburgh with my fantastic wife, [@hilcsr](http://twitter.com/hilcsr), and our hedgehog, Hogs Boson.

You can find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/philip_roberts), [github](http://github.com/latentflip), or email, phil at latentflip dot com.
