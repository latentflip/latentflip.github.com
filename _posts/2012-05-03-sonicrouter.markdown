title: Fresh, free music with Sonic Router
---

I recently came across [Sonic Router](http://www.sonicrouter.com/category/sonic-router-mixes/) which have a nice collection of dubstep/electronic/hip-hop mixes from various artists. One of my favourites so far is by [Lapalux](http://official.fm/tracks/236466).

Bored of opening the Sonic Router homepage, finding the list of mixes, choosing a random one, hitting play, I knocked up a [little Ruby script](https://gist.github.com/2584960) that opens a random one in your browser. And if you have dotjs installed there's a little snippet that will autoplay too.
