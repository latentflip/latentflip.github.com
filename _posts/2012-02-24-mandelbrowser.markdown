A while ago I made a [tool](http://mandelbrowser.heroku.com/#-0.4998193359374997,-0.4990869140624997,-0.519267578125,-0.518779296875,800) that lets you explore the Mandelbrot Set (a famous fractal) using an interface a bit like google maps.

It's rendered using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, and JavaScript. It performs awfully, and the code is hideous - but it does makes pretty pictures, eventually!
